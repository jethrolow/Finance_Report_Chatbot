If so, use this glossary to\\nkeep you on track.\\nBasic Financial Terms\\nSome of the more straightforward financial terms that you might come across are listed below.\\nAccounting Manual:\\n A document that details the accounting policies and procedures of a business. It normally contains\\na list of account codes or chart of accounts. The way a company treats depreciation is an example of an accounting\\npolicy which would be set out in the accounting manual.\\nAccounting Period:\\n The period for which a company prepares its accounts. Management accounts may be produced\\ninternally on a monthly or quarterly basis, whilst financial accounts will be made for a period of one year. An accounting\\nperiod starts when a company begins trading and ends either:\\none year after starting to trade\\nat the end of the period of account, or\\nat the start of a winding-up of operations\\nAccounts:\\n The documents prepared by accountants which give an indication of how a business has performed over a\\nspecified period (usually a year).\\nAccounts Payable (or Creditors):\\n The debts shown on the balance sheet of a buyer, when goods or services have\\nbeen bought on credit.\\nAccounts Receivable (or Debtors):\\n The money owed by customers when they have been sold goods or services on\\ncredit.\\nAccruals:\\n Provisions for liaibilities incurred in an accounting period for which an invoice has not been received.\\nAccruals Basis:\\n A process of revenue calculation that disregards the receiving or dispersal of cash. Instead, services\\nalready rendered are recognised as revenue, and services utilised (or efforts expended) are registered as expenses.\\nBook Value:\\n The amount of money at which an asset is recorded in the financial statements.\\nAvoidable Cost:\\n Costs not continuing if an operation is deleted or modified.\\nBalance Sheet:\\n A statement of financial status at a given point in time.\\nBudget:\\n A plan of action expressed in quantitative monetary terms, i.e. a statement of how much money you will allocate\\nto different items or activities that you or your team will undertake.\\nCapital:\\n Most commonly refers to owner’s equity i.e. the money owners have put into the business.\\nCapital Cost:\\n A capital cost is the cost of purchasing a fixed asset.\\nCapital Expenditure (or Capex):\\n Money spent on a major project or asset, such as premises. Capital expenditure is\\ngiven a value on the balance sheet rather than being written off to the Profit and Loss Account.\\nCash Basis:\\n An accounting process where the timing of cash receipts and payments is the sole calculating factor when\\ndetermining income and expenses.\\nCash Budget:\\n A statement of planned cash receipts and payments.\\nCash Flow Forecast:\\n A cash flow forecast is a way of projecting the likely cash that will flow through the organisation\\nand is useful for predicting any shortfalls that may arise. It is different to the P&L as it shows only cash and it records the\\nlikely timing of cash payments and receipts, usually on a monthly basis. The P&L shows income and expenditure in the\\nperiod when an invoice is issued or received, not when the actual cash is physically received or paid out.\\nContribution Margin:\\n Revenue from sales, minus all variable costs.\\nCost:\\n Financial sacrifice made for goods or services. May be outlay or opportunity costs.', metadata={'source': '../data/Glossary of financial terms.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " '9cc43a5d-2206-43be-a31c-a4a59399d810': Document(page_content='Cost Centre:\\n The small responsibility centre for costs. For instance, this could be a department or even a sub-division of\\na department like a particular assembly line within an assembly department.\\nCost of Goods Sold:\\n Cost of acquired and resold merchandise.\\nCost of Sales:\\n Synonymous with cost of goods sold.\\nCurrent Assets:\\n Cash plus assets that are likely to be converted to cash within the operating cycle (usually within one\\nyear).\\nCurrent Liabilities:\\n Existing debts that will be due to be paid within either the coming year.\\nDepreciation:\\n Depreciation spreads the cost of using an asset over the length of time which it is in use. This cost is\\ncalculated as the cost of purchase less the resale value at the end of the useful economic life.\\nDividend:\\n A way of distributing the profits of a business amongst its shareholders. If a dividend is paid, it is usually paid\\nannually.\\nEarnings:\\n The excess of revenues over expenses.\\nExpense:\\n A gross decrease in assets from the purchasing of goods and services.\\nFixed Assets:\\n An item that is purchased by your organisation for use in its operations. You will be able to use it for more\\nthan a year as it shouldn’t wear out or end up being of no benefit to you before the 12 months is up.\\nTangible Fixed Assets:\\n Physical assets, also referred to as ‘property, plant and equipment’, or ‘plant assets’.\\nFixed Cost:\\n A cost that is not affected by a change of related total activity or volume during a set time period. A cost is\\nfixed if it will not vary with the level of work or production that is taking place, during a given period of time.\\nGoodwill:\\n The value of a business over and above its net tangible assets. This value is derived largely from the market\\nvalue\\nGross Profit:\\n The profits made by a business before overheads and other fixed costs. Essentially gross profit = goods\\nsold - cost of goods sold.\\nIncome:\\n The excess of revenues over expenses. Income and cash are different things. Income is another word for the\\nsales that have been invoiced or funding that has been awarded. Cash is the physical money going into your\\norganisation’s bank account when the invoice or funding is paid.\\nIntangible Assets:\\n A class of non-physical, long-lived assets, e.g. patents and trademarks.\\nLiabilities:\\n The money that an organisation is commited to pay another at some point in the future.\\nLosses:\\n The opposite of profits i.e. when an organisation spends more than it earns.\\nManagement Accounts:\\n Accounts which are prepared for use when managing the business.\\nNet Income:\\n The calculation for a given period of time which registers the excess of revenues and gains over expenses\\nand losses.\\nNet Current Assets:\\n Current assets minus current liabilities.\\nNet Profit:\\n The total profit made by the business after overheads and other fixed costs have been deducted, but before\\nany dividends and tax payments have been made.\\nOperating Cycle:\\n The time span during which cash paid for acquisitions ultimately results in cash paid by purchasers.\\nThe cycle runs as follows: cash spent on acquisitions that are used to produce output, which is sold to customers, who\\npay cash for their purchases.\\nOpportunity Cost:\\n The potential contribution to profit foregone in order to utilise limited resources in another area.\\nPayback Period:\\n The amount of time taken to recoup, in terms of cash inflows, the initial amount of outlay.\\nPrime Costs:\\n Direct-material cost plus direct-labour cost.\\nProduct Costs:\\n Costs identified with goods produced, or goods purchased for resale.', metadata={'source': '../data/Glossary of financial terms.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

In other words, it shows whether\\nthe organisation is making a profit/surplus or a loss/deficit.\\nRevenue Cost:\\n The cost of purchasing an item for use within your organisation. The item is useful to your organisation\\nfor a year or less. It will be used up or stop being of benefit by the time 12 months is up.\\nStraight-Line Depreciation:\\n A calculation of depreciation that allocates the same cost to an asset for each successive\\nyear of its useful life.\\nSunk Cost:\\n Also referred to as ‘historical cost’, this is a cost that has already been incurred, and is therefore irrelevant to\\nthe future decision-making process.\\nTangible Assets:\\n An asset that can be touched and seen, such as land and buildings, fixtures and fittings.\\nTransfer Price:\\n The amount charged for a product or service provided by one segment of an organisation, to another\\nsegment within that same organisation. Transfer prices are prices charged internally, between different parts of the same\\norganisation, for services or products.\\nUncontrollable Cost:\\n A cost that, within a given time span, cannot be affected by the efforts of the manager of a\\nresponsibility centre.\\nVariable Cost:\\n A cost that changes in total in direct proportion to changes in the related total activity or volume. A\\nvariable cost varies in direct proportion to activity.\\nVariance:\\n The unexpected deviation of actual results from those budgeted or expected.\\nWorking Capital:\\n Current assets and current liabilities i.e the amount of money tied up in the day to day operations of\\nthe business.\\nZero-Base Budgeting (or ZBB):\\n A budgeting practice in which managers are asked to justify all of their activities as if\\nthey were being undertaken for the first time.\\nRelated Items\\nRelated Resources\\nAn Introduction to the Key Financial Documents\\nFinance Fundamentals: Internet Links and References', metadata={'source': '../data/Glossary of financial terms.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Our corporate governance structure hasfacilitated several key decisions which have set Tesla up to achieve long-term success and our mission to accelerate theworld’s transition to sustainable energy.\\nSome examples include our decisions to:\\n• Manufacture all-electric vehicles from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components;• Establish an international network of our stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles\\nand the significant capital outlay required to do so;\\n• Build Gigafactory Nevada, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively;• Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a\\nvertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility;\\n• Deploy FSD Beta incrementally, resulting in over 130 million cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta to date; and• Compensate our CEO only if other stockholders realize tremendous value.\\nThese and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these\\nare what differentiate Tesla from other companies.\\nYear-Round Engagement\\nOur Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder\\nfeedback. The Board maintains an active, year-round dialogue with our largest stockholders to ensure that Tesla’s Board andmanagement understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders. This includes focused one-on-onemeetings between our Board and stockholders throughout the year that are designed to give institutional stockholders anopportunity to better understand our strategy and governance and raise any concerns, and allow our directors to becomebetter informed about our stockholders’ views and concerns.\\nBoard Responsiveness\\nThrough the Board’s engagement program discussed above, we have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful\\ninput regarding a number of stockholder-related matters. Moreover, members of the Board and management from time totime seek input from our investors when considering important corporate actions, including our consideration of, andresponses to, stockholder proposals that involve corporate governance and alignment with stockholder interests. As a result,we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to:\\n•\\nProgressively adding directors who are independent under the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”)\\nand bring additional viewpoints and key skills in different areas as we evolve, including Kathleen Wilson- Thompson in 2018,\\nHiromichi Mizuno in 2020, Joe Gebbia in 2022 and JB Straubel as a nominee this year;\\n• Following the passing proposal at the 2022 Annual Meeting relating to proxy access, meeting with key stockholders to\\ndiscuss their views and formulate a framework to address the proposal, after which the Board voted to amend thebylaws of the Company to enable proxy access, in such a manner as to reflect such stockholder views;\\n• Hosting Investor Day in March 2023, in which Tesla leaders presented on key areas important to our success, affording\\nstockholders more detailed assessments of the performance, achievements, growth opportunities and areas of focus forour businesses, and addressing stockholder feedback requesting greater visibility into our business leaders and roadmap;\\n• Amending our pledging policy to (i) cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the\\npledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledgedstock, and (ii) lower the percentage used to calculate the maximum loan or investment amount borrowable bydirectors and officers (other than our CEO) based on the total value of such director or officer’s pledged stock from25% to 15%;\\nTesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 9', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Accordingly, to provide an enhanced voice to ourstockholders in approving fundamental corporate matters, the Board is committed to enabling the elimination of certainsupermajority voting requirements in our charter and bylaws through the process outlined below.\\nIn each of the last four years, our Board repeatedly proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to\\nreduce director terms and/or to eliminate certain supermajority voting. However, such amendments failed to pass each timethat the Board proposed them. Because the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the total outstanding shares entitled to\\nvote is required to approve such amendments, similar proposals cannot pass unless we achieve such a stockholder\\nparticipation rate.\\nIn response to not reaching the required stockholder participation rate, during 2022, we took active steps in an effort to\\nincrease the participation rate of our retail investors through the development of our Shareholder Platform (discussedbelow), outreach campaigns, direct mailings, one-on-one engagements and through social media channels. This resulted inachieving our highest stockholder participation rate in the last five years in 2022 of over 63%, though still short of therequired 66 2/3% participation rate.\\nThis year, we will again marshal our resources and continue our efforts to further increase retail investor participation rates\\nas rapidly as possible, via events such as our 2023 Investor Day, and with an active communications campaign via our newShareholder Platform and social media channels encouraging retail stockholders to vote their shares.\\nOnce we have achieved a total stockholder participation rate of at least 65% at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again\\npropose charter and bylaw amendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. To the extent that this proposal toeliminate supermajority voting requirements achieves the required threshold to pass, this will unlock a gateway for ourBoard and stockholders to adopt further stockholder-driven governance actions, including, without limitation, the right forstockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting, and the declassification of the Board. Furthermore, aspreviously discussed, the Board is consistently listening and receptive to taking further governance actions when appropriate.\\nShareholder Platform\\nIn 2022, building on our efforts to enhance engagement among our retail stockholder base, Tesla launched our Shareholder\\nPlatform. Any Tesla stockholder, regardless of holdings size, can sign up to stay informed about investor-related topics such asquarterly filings and event announcements, and are eligible for selection to participate in in-person access to Tesla events such asthe Tesla Semi launch event, AI Day 2, Investor Day and our annual meetings. Tesla has one of the largest retail stockholder bases ofany public company. Our retail stockholders are incredibly engaged and tend to have a very strong understanding of the Company,and are an important base of support and feedback for management and the Board. We will continue to build the system tomaximize depth of engagement and reach. Our goal is for every stockholder who wants to engage with the Company to have ameaningful framework for interaction through the Shareholder Platform.\\n10 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

This proposal, commonly known as a\\n“say-on-pay” proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to weigh in on our named executive officers’ compensation asa whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive officer, butrather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described inthis proxy statement. We currently have a policy providing for a triennial say-on-pay vote and, in Proposal Three (advisoryvote on the frequency of future executive compensation advisory approvals), the Board recommends that stockholdersapprove an advisory resolution supporting continued triennial say-on-pay votes. Accordingly, we anticipate that the nextadvisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers would occur in 2026.\\nThe say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. The\\nsay-on-pay vote will, however, provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensationphilosophy, policies and practices, which the Compensation Committee will be able to consider when determining executivecompensation for the remainder of the current fiscal year and beyond. The Board and the Compensation Committee valuethe opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officercompensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders’ concerns and the CompensationCommittee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.\\nSummary of the 2022 Executive Compensation Program\\nThe following is a summary of some of the key points of our 2022 executive compensation program:\\n• Tesla continues to emphasize structuring compensation incentives to reward our named executive officers based on\\nperformance.\\n• Equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon\\nthe achievement of clear and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock priceincreases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following theirgrant), our named executive officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.In 2020, the last year any of our named executive officers received equity awards, such awards were all granted inthe form of stock options. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation isentirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance.\\n• Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any\\nperquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. Nonamed executive officer currently has any severance or change of control arrangement.\\n• Each named executive officer is employed at will and is expected to demonstrate exceptional personal performance\\nin order to continue serving as a member of the executive team.\\n• Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage\\nrequirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he hasnever accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning andaccrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s future compensation was at-risk in the form of theremaining unvested stock options under the 10-year performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in\\nJanuary 2018 (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”).\\n• In particular, the 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 equal tranches, each which vested upon the\\nachievement of a market capitalization milestone matched to one of eight revenue-based operational milestones oreight Adjusted EBITDA-based operational milestones, all of which were viewed as difficult hurdles at the time ofgrant.

(“Tesla” or “Company”) shareholders ask the Board of Directors to oversee the preparation and\\nmaintenance of a publicly-disclosed report on Tesla’s Key-Person Risk, including identification of key persons and actions toameliorate the impacts of their potential loss.\\nSupport : Tesla is frequently cited as a prominent example of a company that has so-called Key-Person Risk, due to the\\nprominence of its CEO and the lack of a clear public succession plan or strategy to ameliorate the impacts of his loss.\\nAccording to a 2018 Morgan Stanley report, in 2017 59 S&P 500 CEOs left their companies, and these companies then\\nunderperformed the market by 11% in the subsequent 12 months. Loss of a key person can be due to decisions from the keyperson to part with the company; the company to part with the key person; or outside factors (such as untimely death ordisability)—and all of these are rarely easy to foresee long in advance.\\nThe standard procedure for dealing with Key-Person Risk is:\\n1. Identify key persons.2. Document processes and procedures for their succession.3. Spread knowledge / cross- train successors.4. Manage communication with stakeholders5. Financial mitigation of key-person loss impacts\\nAt present, Tesla shareholders can have little confidence that said risk has been at all ameliorated. Tesla specifically cites as a\\nrisk in its Q3 10-Q: “ We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive\\nOfficer ” - offering no explanation of how it plans to deal with said risk. We ask the board to present to shareholders a clear\\nand unambiguous Key-Person Risk amelioration strategy, documenting that all of the above five points have been met so thatshareholders can be confident that the company will have qualified successors in mind who are prepared to lead thecompany to success in the event of a key-person departure.\\n***\\nOpposing Statement of the Board\\nThe Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would be detrimental to the interests of Tesla and our\\nstockholders.\\nContrary to the proponent’s claims, Tesla does recognize that recruiting and retaining a highly talented and experienced\\nmanagement team, not just the CEO, is critical to Tesla’s success. The Board and the management of Tesla are best equippedto carry out succession planning, as well as to handle day-to-day hiring, promotion and termination decisions. Such decisionstake into consideration numerous criteria that are continually adapted to meet the evolving demands of Tesla, as determinedby the Board and management.\\nAdopting this proposal would cause unnecessary competitive harm to Tesla and undermine our efforts to recruit and retain\\nmanagement.

Furthermore, executives whoare not identified as key persons or potential successors may choose to voluntarily leave Tesla and may create unwelcometensions amongst the management team.\\nAdditionally, the Board already devotes significant time to leadership development efforts and implements several of the\\nprocedures discussed by the proponent above. Through regular discussions in meetings and executive sessions at both theBoard and Committee level, the Board follows certain processes regarding the evaluation of management positions.Furthermore, the Compensation Committee provides guidance for, and reviews and approves, key leadership hiring anddevelopment, and retention plans to manage and mitigate the loss of any key persons.

This discussion contains forward-lookingstatements that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensationprograms.

Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2022 were:\\nName Position\\nElon Musk Technoking of Tesla and Chief Executive Officer\\nZachary Kirkhorn Master of Coin and Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Baglino Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering\\nCompensation Philosophy\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation\\nprograms reflect this—and our startup origins—in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereassalary or wages are intended to meet our employees’ near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are aneffective tool for retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievementof specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. During periods in which ourstock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that thepotential for such increases also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interestsof our employees with the long-term interests of our stockholders. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employeewith the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based bonus programs serving generally toaccommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. By combining salary or wages and our equity award program,we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets.\\nIn particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla’s strategic direction and\\noperations should motivate them to achieve sustainable stockholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simplyremain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stockunits that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, we are increasingly emphasizing for ourexecutive officers the grant of stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to theextent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock optionsare ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greaterproportion of our executive officers’ total level of compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, asustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational milestones may result in a level of totalcompensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation program hasconsisted primarily of equity awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cashretainer payments that may be waived at the election of each director.\\nWe evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by\\nthe Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stockprice experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equitycompensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes.\\n40 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",
       " 'cdff5517-3efa-4cb6-aef4-8f2b9b920ca2': Document(page_content='Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation\\nRole of Compensation Committee in Executive CompensationThe Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility of recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief\\nExecutive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of theCompensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three membersof the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer ofTesla, and each of whom qualifies as (i) an “independent director” under the Nasdaq rules and (ii) an “outside director”\\nunder Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). See “ Corporate Governance—Board Meetings and\\nCommittees—Compensation Committee ” above.\\nRole of Compensation Consultants\\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to engage and has from time to time engaged the services of outside\\nconsultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla’s compensation philosophy and programs,\\nincluding for executives and directors. For example, Compensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm (“Compensia”),was retained as a compensation consultant in 2021 to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to Tesla’scompensation program for its non-employee directors. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on the design ofthe Board’s equity award program for the future period until the Compensation Committee’s and Board’s next review of theprogram, including a consideration of Tesla’s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation inthe form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla’sstockholders. See “ Executive Compensation—Compensation of Directors—Non-Employee Director Compensation\\nArrangements ” below for more detail regarding the review of Board compensation during 2022. Compensia did not provide\\nany services to us in 2022.\\nRole of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions\\nHistorically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and\\nconsidered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers’ responsibilities, performance andcompensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for oursenior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program’s ability to attract, retainand motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believesare qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level,functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla’s performance. The Compensation Committeeconsiders our Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment, andapproves the specific compensation for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, which isapproved by the Board). All such compensation determinations by our Compensation Committee are largely discretionary.\\nThe Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during\\nCompensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Boardwhere the Board acts on the Compensation Committee’s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the\\nBoard has established a management committee under the 2019 Plan (the “Equity Award Committee”) to grant andadminister equity awards, subject to certain maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity AwardCommittee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is notauthorized to grant awards to executive officer-level employees. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity AwardCommittee may not grant awards to its members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards grantedby it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the CompensationCommittee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee.\\nRole of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes\\nAt the 2011 annual meeting of our stockholders and at each annual meeting held every three years since, including most\\nrecently in 2020, we held triennial stockholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on the compensation of our named executiveofficers for the immediately preceding fiscal years. At our 2020 annual meeting, our stockholders overwhelmingly approvedthe compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 83% of our stockholders present and entitled to voteat the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers.

See “ Proposal Three—Tesla Proposal for Non-\\nBinding Advisory Vote on the Frequency of the Future Non-Binding Vote on Executive Compensation. ”\\nClawback Policy\\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth a compensation recovery (“clawback”) policy with respect to any annual\\nincentive payment or long-term incentive payment that may be received by an executive officer, where such payment wouldbe predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement of our financialstatements, and a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial results. In suchcase, the Board has the authority to seek to recover from the executive officer the amount by which such officer’s incentivepayments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financialresults.\\nMoreover, the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our\\nfinancial statements previously filed with the SEC. See “ Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—\\nChief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award ” below.\\nCurrent Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation\\nOverview and Fiscal Year 2022 Company HighlightsOur current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee,\\ngenerally consists of base salary and equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. Wecombine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages with the goal of providing, on a total basis,competitive pay and align the interests of our named executive officers with long-term stockholder interests by tying thevalue of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategicobjectives. In 2022, Tesla’s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following:\\n• Total revenues of $81.46 billion, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, or 51.4%, compared to the prior year;• Net income attributable to common stockholders of $12.56 billion and an operating margin of 16.8%, representing\\nfavorable changes of $7.04 billion and 4.6%, respectively, compared to the prior year;\\n• Annual vehicle delivery and production records of 1,313,851 and 1,369,611 total vehicles, representing an increase of\\n40.3% and 47.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year;\\n• 6.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems deployed; and• Ongoing progress in the global growth of our manufacturing capabilities, including production and ramp at\\nGigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA.\\nBase Salary\\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer’s and other executive officers’ base\\nsalaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles,performance and the competitive market. Because we currently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salaryis the primary cash-based element of our executive officers’ compensation structure.\\n42 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

The\\nequity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock andrestricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We have granted to our namedexecutive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement ofspecified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We are increasingly emphasizing the grantof stock option awards for our named executive officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock priceincreases following their grant. Accordingly, all equity awards granted to our named executive officers in 2020 (the last yearawards were granted to any of our named executive officers) were in the form of stock option awards. As a result, asignificant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock priceperformance.\\nWhile we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we\\ndo not have a rigid set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgmentand discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant. TheCompensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer,competitive market factors, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer,the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation receivedby the named executive officer, to determine the level and types of equity awards that it approves. We generally grantone-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including executives, upon their commencement of employment withus, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation review andalignment process, we periodically grant additional equity awards to our executives, although no such equity awards weregranted in fiscal 2022. See “ Executive Compensation—Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022 ” below.\\nThe Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to\\ntime.

Such grant was subjectto approval by a majority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meetingof the stockholders to approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, withapproximately 73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\nThe 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 303,960,630 shares (as\\nadjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla’s common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranchesthat were each equivalent to 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla’s common stock at the time of grant, at anexercise price of $23.34 per share (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split).

Meeting morethan 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk underthe 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalizationmilestones was based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla’s stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar daytrailing average of Tesla’s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certainacquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/oroperational milestone would have been adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they had beenconsidered material to the achievement of those milestones.\\nIn establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including\\nTesla’s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiplescompanies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks providedrevenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets thataligned with Tesla’s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization andoperational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Teslawas required to add approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEOPerformance Award on a sustained basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla wouldhave to increase revenue by more than $163 billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the lastfiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\nIn addition, Mr. Musk was required to continue leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product\\nOfficer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone wasmet in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires uponexercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vestingof the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk’s termination, death or disability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in achange in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the market capitalizationmilestones, with the measurement of Tesla’s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstandingshares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a shareof Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of anyother consideration) received by Tesla’s stockholders in the change in control.\\nIn the event of a restatement of Tesla’s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO\\nPerformance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment,as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financialresults (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO PerformanceAward is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equityawards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law.\\nAs of the date of this filing, all of the milestones have been achieved and certified by our Board.

However, prior to the enactment of U.S. tax\\nlegislation in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”), certain types of performance-based compensation were excluded from the$1,000,000 deduction limit if specific requirements were met. Under the Tax Act, this exclusion for performance-basedcompensation is not available with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless the compensation ispursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on or before November 2, 2017, and which is not modified in anymaterial respect on or after such date.

       " 'f9886eb9-ee21-4cf4-9d7b-5947e12ca879': Document(page_content='Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements\\nOverview and PhilosophyThe compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation\\nphilosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of theircompensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders.Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if themarket value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form ofstock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increasesfollowing their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and theunderlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has consisted of cash retainer paymentsthat are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director.Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our non-employee directors’ compensation isentirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options then held by each ofour non-employee directors being out-of-the-money.\\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and\\nin light of Tesla’s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stockoption awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla’s stockholders. Following suchreview, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve a resolution that all existing directors foregoany automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previouslyapproved by the Board until July 2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwiseamends such resolution. In June 2021, the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution and in May 2022, theBoard agreed to further forego the Board Stock Option Grants until July 2023 unless the Board earlier acts to amend theDirector Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. The Compensation Committee intends to make furtherrecommendations with respect to the Board’s compensation program for directors, if any, who join the Board after the dateof this resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors, following further periodic reviews.\\nOther Information\\nIf, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to\\nthe director shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable.\\nNon-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board\\ncommittee meetings reimbursed by Tesla.\\nPledging of Shares\\nThe ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherentlyrelated to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture.Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns theirinterests with those of our stockholders.\\nIn order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our\\ndirectors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive ofoptions, warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, providedthat the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed, (i) withrespect to our CEO, the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, or (ii) withrespect to our directors and officers other than our CEO, fifteen percent (15%) of the total value of the pledged stock.\\nExample: A director (other than our CEO) pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price\\nis $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 15% of 1,000 x $800, or $120,000, against such shares. If thestock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $120,000 against thepledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $240,000 and the stock price then decreasesto $1,200, the director must repay $60,000 to maintain compliance with the 15% limit under the pledging policy.\\n58 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 63}),\n",

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage\\nsystems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow ourcustomer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stationsand Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and thesafety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-drivingtechnology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reducemanufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our\\nengineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric\\nvehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other,which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, paid Supercharging andvehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasingof solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture four different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S and X. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan\\nthat we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”)built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-sizeSUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges thatwe offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively.\\nIn December 2022, we began early production and deliveries of the Tesla Semi, our first commercial electric vehicle. We have\\nalso announced several planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, including specialized consumer electricvehicles in Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster. We plan to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving(“FSD”), battery cell and other technologies.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage ProductsPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall is designed to store energy at a home\\nor small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generationcustomers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater capacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a\\nwide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\nSolar Energy Offerings\\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase\\nagreement (“PPA”) arrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources toensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as\\nthrough channel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration withreal estate developers and builders on new homes.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 77}),\n",

We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable,efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrainvehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehiclepowertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model S and Model Xand the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of\\nknowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for ourproducts with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improvedmanufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control\\nsystems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions.We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularlythrough over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based\\ntechnologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardwareto better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks forreal-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options. Although at\\npresent the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality thatrelieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use,when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-airupdates.\\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a\\nnew customer base even as modes of transportation evolve.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics. For example, in\\n2022 we previewed Optimus, a robotic humanoid which is controlled by the same AI system.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage ProductsWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular\\napproach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, ourexpertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems forpower injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The\\nefficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. Wedesigned both products to integrate with Powerwall.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",
       " '8f956ded-bab3-4d7e-a3bc-20a2293048f5': Document(page_content='6Design and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components\\nand systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations,which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, castingand thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate batterypacks to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production\\nfor particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase ourcapabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulationsmodeling these capabilities prior to construction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install\\nenergy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modulardesign of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. Wealso customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet theirspecific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will\\ncontinue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped usachieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect SalesOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some\\njurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the saleof vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educateconsumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales\\nchannels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatilityfrom time to time.\\nUsed Vehicle Sales\\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla\\nvehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequentlyremarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources includinglease returns.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where\\npossible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power.Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners theability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network eitherrequires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees,\\nto offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, todeploy home charging solutions.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n",

We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offercertain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities\\nthrough a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners,and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibilityto make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nServiceWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service\\ntechnicians who perform work remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Performing vehicle service ourselves allows us toidentify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster, and optimize logistics and inventory better, than traditionalautomobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy manyproblems remotely and proactively.\\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell, which may include separate limited\\nwarranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer extended serviceplans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally\\nprovide manufacturer’s limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that areavailable at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installationworkmanship.\\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar\\nRoof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable manufacturers’ warranties.\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\\ncommit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in thecontract.\\nFinancial Services\\nAutomotive\\nPurchase Financing and LeasesWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia\\nourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees orbuyback guarantees that may obligate us to repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.\\nInsurance\\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often\\nbetter than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan toexpand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for ourcustomers.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge afee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the US in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in\\nAustin, Texas, Gigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble,among other things, vehicles, certain vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storagecomponents and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-\\nBrandenburg), which allows us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportationand manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. Generally, we continue to expand production capacity atour existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding localmanufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close\\nrelationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain componentspurchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricingefficiencies from economies of scale.\\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single\\nsuppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it issensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk bymaintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials\\nis governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand andmarket speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and wecurrently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies.\\nOur business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note\\n2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for further details.\\nPrograms and Incentives\\nInflation Reduction ActOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years\\nbeginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promoteclean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits toconsumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualifiedelectric vehicles in the U.S through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”),\\ngreenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply withemission standards and other regulatory requirements.

       " '1fb380ba-9e3c-44ff-8587-1cf44db4b730': Document(page_content='9Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and\\nfinancial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S.\\nfederal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable theparticipation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adoptedprocurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California SelfGeneration Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers maytransfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation andstorage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage\\ntechnology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which maybe claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These taxcredits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the\\ncost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatementsand rebates.\\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified\\ncommercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase,or by us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarilyfor the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2023 or later.\\nRegulations\\nVehicle Safety and TestingIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including\\nall applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to ourvehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that ourvehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject tochange from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSAbumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel\\nEconomy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing,Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, aStanding General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, andadditional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. AutomobileInformation and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding themanufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economyratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New CarAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations.\\nMany of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of thoseregulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regardingadditional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features\\nthat we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-drivingequipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturerreporting obligations, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipmentor features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect toself-driving vehicles in the U.S.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",
       " '30cc4afc-e506-46fe-9e23-782ed3bc70ca': Document(page_content='10In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, some requirements restrict the\\ndesign of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicablelaws, both current and proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the marketswhere they apply.\\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ\\nmaterially from those in the U.S. and Europe, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit orprevent certain features.\\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor\\nvehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the lawsin such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that theyotherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of stateswhere we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened “galleries”that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative\\nand legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealerassociations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways notfavorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and weintend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined\\nto include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance withsuch regulations.\\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and\\ndisposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may addadditional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs,and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\\nSolar Energy—General\\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity.\\nTo operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-saleequipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows\\nsolar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving abill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators orutilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.\\nCompetition\\nAutomotive\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we\\nintroduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’capabilities.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",

For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competingproducts typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many establishedand new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuelvehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rentalcar company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehiclesrelative to the internal combustion vehicle.

RISK FACTORS\\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could\\nmaterially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing ourcompany. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\\nWe may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and\\nshifting social behaviors have, at times, limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities andperson-to-person interactions. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist andmay also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic.\\nFor example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays,\\nresulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has createda shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production. In addition, labor shortages resultingfrom the pandemic, including worker absenteeism, has led to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and serviceworkers, as well as increased labor costs and supplier delays. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readinessand solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including fortravel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg andGigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges. Additionally, infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate invarious regions, which may impact operations. For example, in 2022, spikes in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai resulted in the temporaryshutdown of Gigafactory Shanghai, as well as parts of our supply chain, and impacted our ability to deliver cars.\\nWe cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to\\nmonitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt toaccurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resourcesaccordingly. Lastly, rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, whichmay harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or donot maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend suchoperations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to\\ncontrol our manufacturing costs.\\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and\\nfeatures. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X andexperienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes.

There is no\\nguarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3\\nand Model Y. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturingcapabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at ourmanufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites. We will also need to hire, train andcompensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced inthe past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturingprocesses and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustainingour Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy\\nstorage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificialintelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to buildand bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.\\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and\\nproduction ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm ourbrand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or\\nwe may be unable to manage these components effectively.\\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers,\\nwhich exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing,including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the globalCOVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control couldalso affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. For example, a global shortage ofsemiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supplychain and production. In addition, a spike in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai in early 2022 led to temporary manufacturing shutdowns ofcertain of our suppliers. We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate certain challenges caused by theseshortages, but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet our growth targets.Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocatesufficient production to us, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability ofany component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of accessto important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our abilityto fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production, such as for Model 3 and ModelY, or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amountof time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost,quality and volume needs, or to do so may cost us more, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, we havelimited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai and we may experience issuesincreasing the level of localized procurement at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas. While we believe that wewill be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is noassurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiatewith existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certainparts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in light of the increases in materials pricing. Anyof these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport\\ncomponents at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally.

We are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y\\na global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projectingdemand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if ourspecific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to thevehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise,as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecastdemand in various markets.\\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As\\nour production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes,particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such asdeliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable orbe accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production andinstallation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition andoperating results may be harmed.\\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain\\nauthorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experienceunforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y,it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires usto continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.\\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle\\ncharging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth orcoverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investmentsand management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that wewill be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to ensureour compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products,the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage our growtheffectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and\\nmanufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs.\\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will\\nrequire substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic andContemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited numberof such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our supplierscould limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our supplierswith cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",

However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to\\nrequire, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that wehave planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production orprocure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon\\nthe prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuateand their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as aresult of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unableto meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and qualityneeds, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access tocells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increasedprices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operatingresults.\\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in\\nan automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and\\nTesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehiclesdecreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating resultsmay be harmed.\\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles\\ncould be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\\n• perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\\n• perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to\\ncharging facilities;\\n• competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-\\neconomy internal combustion engine vehicles;\\n• volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy, such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020;\\n• government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\\n• concerns about our future viability.\\nFinally, the target demographics for our vehicles, particularly Model 3 and Model Y, are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in\\nthe automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility.\\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For\\nexample, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitiveentry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobilemanufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and otheralternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technologyand other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in importantmarkets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in thefuture. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design,development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in ourlower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and\\nservice providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices ofelectricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to anincreased rate of customer defaults.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

We also produce several vehicle components at ourGigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. In the past, some of themanufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additionalbottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. In addition, as the IRAprovides new incentives for domestic energy production and manufacturing, we may face increasing competition from otherautomobile manufacturers as well as suppliers for the resources and capacity to build additional factories and expand our operationsdomestically. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, whichmay harm our business and operating results.\\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored\\nand recycled at our various facilities.

Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly aspossible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. While we haveperformed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, we currently have a limited frame ofreference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics. There can be noassurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers.\\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in\\nthe event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicleshave been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidentswhere Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD Capability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especiallyin light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistancesystems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse orclaimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering.

While we have designed our battery\\npacks to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that afield or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash.Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail orcause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, productrecalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and beexpensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicleexposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts,\\ninvestors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidencemay be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products;any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertaintyregarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance comparedwith market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla’s products, business,results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are well-publicized by a range of third parties. Suchattention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability ofour management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficultto raise additional funds if needed.\\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our\\nvarious financing programs.\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various\\nfinancial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets.Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with usunder which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by astream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systemswhereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If wedo not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection lawsgoverning these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately\\nproject our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms dependingon various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We have madein the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, whichmay impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The funding and growth ofthis program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to adequately fund ourleasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are notavailable for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, ifour vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levelsof residual risk.\\nSimilarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under\\nwhich such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actualresale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changesdiscussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lowerthan the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to\\ncustomer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable orunwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we mayincur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",

Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandateemployee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respectto the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees,they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From timeto time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfairlabor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future. InSeptember 2019, an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on certainothers. In March 2021, the NLRB adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others. Tesla appealed the decision to theUnited States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit, which is currently pending. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have anegative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees.

As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts,we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed theminimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees,we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls caused byfailures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operationsor fail to honor their warranties.\\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating\\nresults may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace itemsunder warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products thatwe have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, maycause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and\\nother claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage.

In addition, as we have increased our employee headcount andoperations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations relating toallegations such as discrimination and workplace misconduct, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfullydefend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualifiedemployees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture,import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., weare required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different fromequivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatorycompliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agenciesprior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with\\ncertain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in thedriving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international,federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, registration and operationof Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including full self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a humandriver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operatedby a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex orconflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which couldadversely affect our business.\\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier\\nof electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

If regulations and policies are introduced thatadversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storagesystems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten theeconomics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevantjurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\\nAny failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or\\ninternational privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security andtransfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines,damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required inconnection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities ofour activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certainemerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and mayrequire extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost orattractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the GeneralData Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the EuropeanUnion, and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Similarly, the CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to Californiaresidents. Finally, new privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China. In addition to the risks related to generalprivacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and datalocalization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could include ongoing auditrequirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting inmandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security andintegrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breachrequirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwiseexperience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information.

It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licensesfrom state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sellvehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicablestate motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing beliefthat state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world. Insome states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, wouldprevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation thatclarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate.The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have\\nentered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area canbe complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with ourability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\\nresponse to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $384.29 per share and a low of $101.81 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split in theform of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “2022 Stock Split”). The stock market in general, and the market for technologycompanies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate tothe operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may inthe future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencingvolatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control mayadditionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actualoperating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares,securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or anyfuture stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other\\nfactors.\\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the\\npace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding ourcurrent manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, ourrevenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we developand introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results,especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of futureperformance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, whomay be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fallsubstantially, either suddenly or over time.\\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock\\nprice to decline.\\nWe may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying\\nkey factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may notultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps.Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally arenot linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidancevaries from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur asa result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-\\nperformance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products andservices based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.\\nIn 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain\\nand logistics challenges and factory shutdowns. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and deliverycapabilities, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability andefficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure.\\nIn 2022, we deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage products and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently\\nfocused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, andincreasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems.\\nIn 2022, we recognized total revenues of $81.46 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, compared to the\\nprior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increaseddeliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth.\\nIn 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.56 billion, representing a favorable change of $7.04\\nbillion, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operationalefficiencies.\\nWe ended 2022 with $22.19 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $4.48 billion from\\nthe end of 2021. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 and 2021 were $14.72 billion and $11.50 billion,respectively, representing an increase of $3.23 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $7.16 billion during 2022, compared to $6.48billion during 2021. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number ofcapital-intensive projects in upcoming periods.\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook\\nAutomotive—Production\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under\\ndevelopment, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\\nProduction Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status\\nFremont Factory Model S / Model X Active\\nModel 3 / Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Berlin-BrandenburgModel Y Active\\nGigafactory Texas Model Y Active\\nCybertruck Tooling\\nGigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production\\nTBD Tesla Roadster In development\\nTBD Robotaxi & Others In development', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",

The next phase ofproduction growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add toour available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lowercapital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increaseaffordability.\\nHowever, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be\\nexacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects,any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as theCOVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterativemanufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive—Demand and Sales\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our\\nvehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. We will also continue togenerate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based onartificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as the Tesla Semi inDecember 2022. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasingenvironmental awareness.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to\\ntrade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest ratesand any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the earlier part of 2022, the automotive industry ingeneral experienced part shortages and supplier disruptions which impacted production leading to a general increase in vehiclepricing. As the year progressed, inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend,central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease andfinance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which mayexpose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplaceand help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain ourmomentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, andorder rate for our vehicles, and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments.\\nAutomotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure\\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not\\nbecome a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Beginning the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicletransportation capacity during peak delivery periods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week,which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the year. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at GigafactoryShanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect tobenefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the production launch at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Austin. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increaseand staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize ourSupercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing thecapability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase\\nthe production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can varymeaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growinggrid stability concerns drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering alow-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and priceefficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storageproducts and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n",

We are simultaneouslyramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of newbattery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at whichwe meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of newprojects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuinginfrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billionin 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and\\nwith better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth isalso facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more verticalintegration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to seeheightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects andrising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and laboravailability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long asmacroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\nOperating Expense Trends\\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor\\ncosts and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues todecrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to continue to growin 2023 as we are expanding our operations globally.\\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. As with any investment and consistent with how\\nwe manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time basedon the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-livedintangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for suchassets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upwardrevisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negativelyimpact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. Forexample, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carryingvalue of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\\n(“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures.

       " '57f776a4-5b37-4475-80b5-d4c509c3ee09': Document(page_content='35Revenue Recognition\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features\\nand services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue\\nfrom Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and\\nover-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control ofa vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary tothe business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales returnreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees orsimilar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited freeSupercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on astraight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Superchargingincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these otherfeatures and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related toFSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time.For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliverthe service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against\\nautomotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles.As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed asincurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we haveelected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customeras an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction priceof automotive contracts.\\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who\\nfinance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment forthe vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during theguarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determinedresale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has asignificant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determinewhether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option isexercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly basis, weassess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to thelikelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditionschange, there may be material changes to their estimated values.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy\\nproducts, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsoleteinventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our futuredemand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale\\nof the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert theinventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is establishedand subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be\\nrequired. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 108}),\n",
       " 'e02cecf6-1005-4353-8d0a-c3cabcc88742': Document(page_content='36Warranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the\\nenergy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for theproducts sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls ifidentified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of futureclaims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projectedwarranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projectedwarranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts orPPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to beincurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included withinOther long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in theconsolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily relatedto our automotive segment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and\\nfor our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-basedawards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offeringdate using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-freeinterest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fairvalue of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost isrecognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vestingperiod, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense isrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement\\nperiod of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation ofour stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensationexpense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in theconsolidated statements of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our\\nprovision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred taxassets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent withour future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditionsincluding fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Unionand a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2022, we had recorded a fullvaluation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred taxassets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could bematerially impacted.\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many\\ntransactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertaintyon our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite ourbelief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not befully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions,which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit bythe various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that ourconsideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience andinterpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of atax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differsfrom our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Theeventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred taxassets in the period that such determination is made.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 109}),\n",

The cash we\\ngenerate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects fornew products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturingfacilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp ofGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops,Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities.\\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be\\nable to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operationsdecrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose tocorrespondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best toraise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns onexisting or new debt facilities or financing funds.

Our operating cash inflowsinclude cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales ofregulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers forproduction materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest paymentson our financings.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.23 billion to $14.72 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022\\nfrom $11.50 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net incomeexcluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $7.65 billion, offset by the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of$4.43 billion. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the yearended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a larger increase of accounts payableand accrued liabilities, to support the ramp up in production at our factories and larger increases in other non-current assets andprepaid expenses and other current assets. Additionally, the increase in our net operating assets and other liabilities was partially offsetby a larger increase in other long-term liabilities as compared to the prior year.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which\\nwere $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $6.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly for theexpansions of Gigafactory Texas, the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Shanghai.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on theCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. Weare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and arerequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Teslavehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs torepair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and anestimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical\\naudit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehiclemodels; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’ssignificant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effortinvolved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’sestimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significantassumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claimsincurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one of the following: (i) testing management’s process fordetermining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an independent estimate of theautomotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate toevaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management’s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significantassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty.Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items underwarranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing priorperiod forecasted claims to actual claims incurred. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness andaccuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimationof future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in developing an independent estimate of theautomotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects ofmanagement’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2023\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We\\ndesign, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, andoffer services related to our products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes ourcompany, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and(ii) energy generation and storage.\\nSince the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an easing of\\nrestrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. There are ongoing global impacts resulting from thepandemic, and we have been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments andimpediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. In addition, we have experienced and areexperiencing the impacts of varying levels of inflation caused by the COVID ‐19 pandemic and general global economic conditions.\\nOn August 5, 2022, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock by 4,000,000,000 shares and our Board of\\nDirectors declared the 2022 Stock Split. Each stockholder of record on August 17, 2022 received a dividend of two additional sharesof common stock for each then-held share, distributed after close of trading on August 24, 2022. All share and per share amountspresented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the 2022 Stock Split.\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and\\noperations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We\\nhave formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetizationof certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical conditionfor a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financialinterest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that mostsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially besignificant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do notconsolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We havedetermined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16 , Variable Interest Entity Arrangements ). We evaluate our\\nrelationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompanytransactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Theestimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales returnreserves, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets,goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subjectto leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required anupdate to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuanceof this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actualresults could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial\\nstatements and the accompanying notes.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

Actualreturn rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of ourreserve of $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented increases in automotive sales revenue. Thenet release or increase of reserves which impacted automotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December 31,2022 and December 31, 2020. Further, $324 million of the total revenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to thegeneral FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features\\nand services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD features, internetconnectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to thecustomer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or inaccordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over thecontractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected futuremarket values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to ourinternet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned uponcontrol transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver suchservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever isearlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expectedownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portionrelated to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone sellingprice by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information thatmay be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against\\nautomotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles.As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed asincurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we haveelected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customeras an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction priceof automotive contracts.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 127}),\n",
       " '56b554d5-0caa-48ca-81cf-abdd76f447c5': Document(page_content='55We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who\\nfinance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment forthe vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during theguarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determinedresale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has asignificant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determinewhether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option isexercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly basis, weassess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to thelikelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditionschange, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale valueguarantees was $91 million and $223 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $40 million and $91 millionwas short-term, respectively.\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air\\nsoftware updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear ended December 31,\\n2022 2021\\nDeferred revenue— beginning of period $ 2,382 $ 1,926\\nAdditions 1,178 847\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts (67) (25)\\nRevenue recognized (580) (366)\\nDeferred revenue— end of period $ 2,913 $ 2,382\\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or\\npartially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021was $472 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarterof 2022. We had recognized revenue of $312 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020, for the year endedDecember 31, 2021. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize $639 million of revenuein the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over theperformance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have\\nrecorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $128 million is recorded within Accounts receivable,net, for the current portion and $665 million is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31,2022.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas,\\nfuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emissionstandards and other regulatory requirements.\\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance\\nwith payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which havenegligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party.Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenuerecognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was immaterial for the years ended December 31,2022 and 2021.

       " '6b1be399-4171-469c-b49b-262a211b24ba': Document(page_content='56Automotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in\\nEurope. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term,customers are generally required to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We recordleasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation ofthese vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $1.75billion, $1.25 billion and $752 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we haddeferred $407 million and $392 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-linebasis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under\\nASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may\\nnot have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, thecustomer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for whichthere is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customerto take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our arrangements under these programscan have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasingrevenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based onthe implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For theyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $683 million, $369 million and $120 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $427 million, $234 million and $87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, paid\\nSupercharging, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue.\\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to thecustomer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standaloneselling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performanceobligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to thecustomer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable uponcustomer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferredrevenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to\\nresidential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and smallscale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercialcustomers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation isrecognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility orthe authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of theinstallation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has beendelivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made uponinvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering,\\ndesign and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of aproject. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as apercentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solarenergy system sales.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 129}),\n",
       " 'aa71005b-63b9-4923-ad9f-4a5b4bcbb7ab': Document(page_content='57In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various\\nobligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based onestimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installationsbefore the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets.Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain acontract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storagesystems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year,the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance\\nguarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performancerequirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specifiedlevel. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we maybe required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solarenergy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy marketparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimatedat contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance databecomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal ofrevenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for\\nprepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $863 million and $399 million, respectively, mainly due to milestonepayments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $171 million and $93million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure ofthe amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with anoriginal expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount correspondsdirectly with the value of the performance to date.

The fair value of stock option awards with only serviceand/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs aresubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fairmarket value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provideservice in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and sixmonths for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement\\nperiod of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation ofour stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensationexpense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in theconsolidated statements of operations.\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain\\nfunding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operatingleases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We havefurther determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balancesthat reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value(“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in thenet assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet asnoncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amountsreported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amountsthe third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the netassets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at thebalance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds aredetermined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balancesheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and thethird parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemablenoncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since thesethird parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there may be significantfluctuations in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due tochanges in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached.\\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income\\nattributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period.

Our accountsreceivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during thelast few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year ormore to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them.

Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy\\nproducts, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsoleteinventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our futuredemand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale\\nof the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert theinventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is establishedand subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be\\nrequired.

Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded, forfeited or applied towards thecustomer’s purchase balance.\\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements.\\nGovernment incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction ofexpense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive havebeen met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt. The government incentives received by us areimmaterial in all periods presented since the adoption of ASU 2021-10.\\nGigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease\\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the\\nlease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We arerequired to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement,the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition andcommissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of suchamount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the\\nEnergy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 138}),\n",

Under the terms of\\nthe arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used inconnection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we received grant funding of $76 million and $6 million, respectively. These incentivesoffset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plantand equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over theuseful lives of the related equipment.\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey\\nCounty in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits ofup to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas\\npursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of ourproperty would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metricsthrough our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses withinthe Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations.\\nDefined Contribution Plan\\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of\\nthe Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees mayelect to contribute up to 90% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began tomatch 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation,vested upon one year of service. We recognized $91 million of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings planduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adoptedIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract\\nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combinationto recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenuerecognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquiredcontracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscalyears. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period.If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurredduring the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financialstatements.\\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates\\nthe accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losseson Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loanrefinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends theguidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financingreceivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning afterDecember 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU would be applied prospectively. Earlyadoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact onour consolidated financial statements.\\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The\\nIRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, inaddition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profitsgreater than $1 billion.

The ASU deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December31, 2024. The ASU is effective as of December 21, 2022 through December 31, 2024. We continue to evaluate transactions or contractmodifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis.We adopted ASU 2022-06 during 2022. The ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.\\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). This ASU requires business\\nentities to disclose information about government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by analogy to either agrant or a contribution accounting model. The disclosure requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accountingpolicy used, the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations that are affected and the amounts applicable to eachfinancial statement line item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The ASU is effective for annual periodsbeginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure requirements can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to alltransactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and newtransactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2022. Adoptionof this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nASU 2020-06\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own\\nEquity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversionfeatures that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result insubstantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the hostcontract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also resultin the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying theguidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debtinstruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and nolonger allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how anentity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities.\\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of\\ninitially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombinationof the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible seniornotes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had theeffect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalizedinterest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported underthe accounting standards in effect for those periods.\\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of\\nthe ASU was as follows (in millions):\\nBalances at\\nDecember 31, 2020Adjustments from\\nAdoption of ASU 2020-\\n06Balances at\\nJanuary 1, 2021\\nAssets\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 12,747 $ (45)$ 12,702\\nLiabilities\\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases 2,132 50 2,182\\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion 9,556 219 9,775\\nMezzanine equity\\nConvertible senior notes 51 (51) —\\nEquity\\nAdditional paid-in capital 27,260 (474) 26,786\\nAccumulated deficit (5,399 ) 211 (5,188 )', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 140}),\n",

The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Noteswere automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of ourcommon stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year endedDecember 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in theissuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.\\n2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\\nIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds\\nfrom the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.\\nAs adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into\\n48.4140 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject toadjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15,2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the followingcircumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if thelast reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period inwhich the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of theproduct of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specifiedcorporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combinationthereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us torepurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accruedand unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate fora holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.

The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby theholders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $40.50 pershare, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants.Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase theoverall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accountingcriteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as derivatives. Thenet cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additionalpaid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nThe closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30\\nconsecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter.During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled incash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjustedto give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes wereautomatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our commonstock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value ofthe notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $186 million.\\nCredit Agreement\\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit\\nAgreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) thehighest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availabilityunder the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.\\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a\\nsyndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optionalone-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certaincircumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variablerate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate)plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index averagereference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus anapplicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the“Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.15% perannum.\\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities\\n(“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in thefinancial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments onthe Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs.We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. TheSPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\\nSolar Asset and Loan-backed Notes\\nOur subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in\\ncertain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notesbacked by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and areconsolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by theunderlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset and Loan-backedNotes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available toour other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to ourother assets. We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energysystems.

We determine if an arrangement is alease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the datewhen the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account\\nfor lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with theexception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, thetiming and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, ifaccounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12\\nmonths or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Allother lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term atcommencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing ratebased on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also\\ninclude options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term.

JP Morgan filed a motion forjudgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 158}),\n",

Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict of $136.9\\nmillion against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work atTesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request fora new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. The Court held a hearing on Tesla’s motion on January 19, 2022. On April 13, 2022,the Court granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages to $15 million and conditionally denied the motion for a new trialsubject to the plaintiff’s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result,on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, to commence on March 27, 2023. Tesla continues to believe that thefacts and law do not justify the damages awarded and is assessing its next steps.\\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”)\\nfiled a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostilework environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. OnSeptember 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failingto follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer. Tesla has untilFebruary 3, 2023 to amend its cross complaint. The case is now in discovery.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla\\nthat closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. Tesla is in the process of setting up a mandatory mediation with the EEOC.\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of\\nTexas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach offiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and genderdiscrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damagespayable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffsfiled a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response ofJanuary 13, 2023, and the defendants’ reply is due February 17, 2023.\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\nWe receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety\\nAdministration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state, federal, andinternational agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal andinformal requests and other investigations and inquiries.\\nFor example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering\\ntaking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seekinginformation on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended.\\nSeparately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. To\\nour knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predictthe outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists thepossibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position.\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an\\nunfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.', metadata={'source': '../data/Tesla_Annual_Report_2022.pdf', 'page': 159}),\n",
